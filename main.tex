\section{Electric Force and Field}
\subsection{Coulomb's Law}
\dfn{Subatomic Particles}{
Opposite charges attract, like charges repel.\\
The smallest unit of charge is the electron.\\\
Where an electron $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} C$\\
- Protons have a charge of $+e$\\
- Electrons have a charge of $-e$\\
- Neutrons have no charge (0)\\
An electron has a mass of $9.11 \times 10^{-31} kg$
} \noindent
\nt{
\textbf{Insulators} are materials that do not allow electrons to move freely.\\
\textbf{Conductors} are materials that allow electrons to move freely.\\
\textbf{Polarization} is the seperation of charges within an object.
}
\dfn{Coulomb's Law}{
  The force between two charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
\begin{multicols}{2}
  In vector form:
  $$ \hat{F_E} = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r} $$

Where $q_1$ exerts and $q_2$ feels.\\
$k = 9.0 \times 10^9 Nm^2/C^2$ is the constant of proportionality.
\\\\We derive $k$ from the following equation:
\[ k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\]
Where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} C^2/Nm^2$ 
}
\qs{}{Calculate the components of the net force on Q in the folowing situation.}
\subsection{Electric Fields}
We say that all of spaace contains an \textbf{Electric/Gravitational Field} within which charges/masses get to play.
\\Where each force has it's own exclusive field taht its player (charges/mass) get to interact in.\\
\dfn{Electric Field}{
  The electric field at a point in space is the force per unit charge that would be exerted on a positive test charge placed at that point.
Simply, an electric magnitude and direction for every point in space.
\\\\Where in general ($q$ is a positive test charge):
\[\hat{E} = \frac{\hat{F_E}}{q} \quad \text{measured in} \quad V/C \]
In the specific case of point charges:\\
Such that if we have two charges Q and q $\implies F_{Qq}$. $Q$ exerts and $q$ feels.
\[\hat{E} = k\dfrac{Q}{r^2}\hat{r}\]
Postive charges have electric fields that point \textbf{away} from them.\\
Negative charges have electric fields that point \textbf{towards} them.
\double
The E-field inside a conductor is zero.\\
The E-field inside a nonconducting uniform charge density that is spherically symmetric is zero.
}
\subsection{Continuous Charge Distributions}
\dfn{Continuous Charge Distributions}{
  We can treat any arbitrary massive number of charges as a continuous charge distribution with an appropriate density.
\\\\This density can be a linear (line) charge density $(\lambda)$, surface charge density $(\sigma)$, or a volume charge density $(\rho)$.
\\\\We can then calculate a small bit of the electric field $(d \vec{E})$ due to a small bit of charge $(dq)$.
\\Where $dq$ is the density of the charge times the infinitesimal bit of length, area, or volume of the charge.
$$  d \vec{E}=\frac{k}{r^2} \hat{r} dq= \begin{cases}\dfrac{k}{r^2} \hat{r} \lambda d L & \text { Lines } \\ \dfrac{k}{r^2} \hat{r} \sigma d A & \text { Surfaces } \\ \dfrac{k}{r^2} \hat{r} \rho d V & \text { Volumes }\end{cases} $$
Such that upon integrating over the entire charge distribution, we get the total electric field:
$$ \vec{E}=\begin{cases}\int \dfrac{k}{r^2} \hat{r} \lambda d L & \text { Lines } \\ \int \dfrac{k}{r^2} \hat{r} \sigma d A & \text { Surfaces } \\ \int \dfrac{k}{r^2} \hat{r} \rho d V & \text { Volumes }\end{cases} $$

\qs{Determining the E-field for a uniform general shape}{Determine the E-field for anywhere along the axis of symmetry for a uniform circular ring of charge.}
\sol Lets first draw a diagram of the situation.
\imgg{21.2}{0.5}
We have a ring of charge with radius $R$, where we have an infinitesimal bit of charge $dq$ with an infinitesimal bit of length $dl$.
\\ We can use pythagorean theorem to determine the distance from $dq$ to the point $P$. Where $r = \sqrt{R^2 + y^2}$.
\\ Since the charge is around a ring, we can say that $\vec{E}_x = 0$ due to symmetry. Thus all we care about is the $y$ component of the electric field, where $F_y = |F_E|\cos\theta = |F_E|\frac{y}{r}$.
\\ Out linear charge density is just the total charge divided by the total length of the ring, where $\lambda = \dfrac{Q_{\text{tot}}}{2\pi R}$.
\double Such that our infinitesimal electric field is:
$$ dE_y = k \dfrac{dq}{r^2} cos\theta$$
Our infinitesimal charge is:
$$ dq = \lambda dl $$
Solving for our E-field (where we add up all the infinitesimal charges along the ring):
$$ E_y = \int_0^{2\pi R} \dfrac{k \lambda}{r^2} cos\theta dl $$
Where upon substituting and simplifying, we get:
$$ \boxed{E_y = k Q_{\text{tot}} \cdot \dfrac{y}{(R^2 +y^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}} $$
\section{Gauss's Law}
\subsection{Flux and Area Vectors}
\dfn{Flux ($\Phi$)}{
Flux is how much "stuff" flows through an area.
\\Where max flow is the input perpendicular to the "stuff," and min flow is the input parallel to the "stuff."
\\\\The electric flux for simple (planer) surfaces:
$$ \Phi_{E} = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} = EAcos\theta $$
The electric flux for arbitrary surfaces:
$$ \Phi_{E} = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} $$
}
\dfn{Gauss's Law}{
  $$ \Phi_{E} = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \dfrac{Q_\text{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0} $$
  Where the ideal conditions are:
\nlist{
  \item If we can pick a surface such that $\vec{E}$ is constant and perpendicular to $d\vec{A}$.
  \item Pick a geometry of a known area.
  \item If the $\vec{E}$ has the same value everywhere on the surface.
}
}
\nt{When determining the $\vec{E}_{\text{inside}}$ and $\vec{E}_{\text{outside}}$ using Gauss's Law, setting the surface of the area equal to the $Q_{\text{enclosed}}$ will result them being equal to each other. }
\qs{}{
  A solid sphere of total charge $Q$ and a radius $R$ has a non-uniform charge density of $Ar^2$ where $A$ is a cnstant.
  \\ A) Determine $A$ in terms of $Q$ and $R$.
  \\ B) Determine the E-field for anywhere inside this sphere.
}
\sol
\\ A) We know that the total charge $Q$ is equal to $\rho V$. Since the charge density is non-uniform/charge density depends on the radius, we must integrate over the radius.
More specifically, we must add up infetisimal thick shells of charge from $0$ to $R$.
$$
Q \rho V = \int_{0}^{R} \rho dV = \int_{0}^{R} Ar^2 (4\pi r^2 dr)
$$
$$\implies \boxed{A = \dfrac{5Q}{4\pi R^5}} $$
B) We can use Gauss's Law to determine the E-field for anywhere inside this sphere.
\\We can use a spherical Gaussian surface inside the solid sphere with radius $r_{\text{in}}$.
$$
\oint \vec{E_{\text{in}}} \cdot d\vec{A} = \dfrac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}
$$
Since the E-field is parallel to the area vector (where the dot product is 1), we can simplify the equation to:
\begin{align*}
  E_{\text{in}} dA = \dfrac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}
  \\ E_{\text{in}} (4\pi r_{\text{in}}^2) = \dfrac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}
\end{align*}
Like part a of this problem, we must integrate over the radius to determine the total charge enclosed.
\begin{align*}
  Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_{0}^{r_{\text{in}}} \rho dV &= \int_{0}^{r_{\text{in}}} Ar^2 (4\pi r^2 dr)
  \\ Q_{\text{enc}} &= A4\pi \frac{r_{\text{in}}^5}{5}
\end{align*}
Where upon simplifying and substituting, we get:
$$\boxed{E_{\text{\text{in}}} = kQ(\dfrac{r_{\text{in}}^3}{R^5})} $$

\section{Electric Potential}
\dfn{Electric Potential Energy}{
  $$ U_E = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r} $$
  $$ \vec{F_E} = -\nab U_E = - (\frac{\partial U_E}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial U_E}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial U_E}{\partial z})$$
  $$ \Delta U_E = -W$$
  Remember that:
  $$ K_i + U_i + W_{\text{ext}} = K_f + U_f $$
}
\dfn{Voltage (Electric Potential)}{
  The scalar field describing the eletric potential energy per unit charge.
  $$ \Delta V = \frac{\Delta U_E}{q} \quad \text{measured in Volts $V$}$$
  Where on a point charge (where $q$ exerts):
  $$ V_{\text{PC}} = \frac{kq}{r} $$
  $$ \Delta V = -\int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{r} = -Edcos\theta $$
  $$ \Delta V = - \vec{E} \cdot \Delta \vec{r} = ||\vec{E}|| ||\Delta \vec{r}|| cos\theta $$
  What matters is not the amount of voltage, but the difference in voltage.
  \\Voltage is negative the area under an $\vec{E}$ vs ${\vec{r}}$ graph.
  \\Voltage difference is path independent. i.e. you only care about the start and end points.

\qs{External work to bring a charge from infinity to a point}{
  Determine the work required to bring $q = 3.0 \cdot 10^{-6}$ C charge from infinity to 0.5 m away from $Q = 20 \cdot 10^{-6}$ C charge.
}
\sol Where there is no kinetic energy, we can use the following equation (we only care about the magnitude):
\begin{align*}
  |-W| &= |\Delta U_E|
  \\ W &= U_f - U_i
  \\ &= \frac{(3)(20)(10 \cdot 10^{-12})}{0.5} - \frac{(3)(20)(10 \cdot 10^{-12})}{\infty}
  \\ &= \frac{(3)(20)(10 \cdot 10^{-12})}{0.5} - 0
  \\ &= \boxed{1.08 \text{ J}}
\end{align*}
\qs{Analyzing Voltage and Electric Potential Energy}{
  Consider the diagram below where two parallel plates have potentials $+V$ and $-V$ respectively. If an electron is placed near the negative plate, what can we say about the change in its electric potential $(V)$ and the electric potential energy $(U_E)$?
  \imgg{ex23.1}{0.4}
}
\sol Using the formula: $\Delta V = V_f - V_i$
\\ We understand that the electron will move from the negative plate to the positive plate.
\\ Thus, $\Delta V = +V - (-V) = 2V \implies \boxed{\Delta V > 0} $
\\ Using the formula: $\Delta V = \frac{\Delta U_E}{q}$ we derive $\Delta U_E = \Delta V q$
\\ When examining the signs of $\Delta V$ and $q$, $\Delta U_E = (+)(-) \implies \boxed{\Delta U_E < 0}$
\qs{}{

\dfn{Equipotential Lines}{
  Equipotential lines provide a quantitative way of viewing the electric potential in two dimensions.
  \\Every point on a given line is at the same potential. Represented as contour maps.
  The electric field at a point can be calculated:
  $$ \vec{E} = -\nab V = - (\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial V}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}) = -\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta x}$$ 
  Rules for drawing equipotential lines:
  \nlist{
    \item Electric field lines are perpendicular to the equipotential lines, and point in the direction of decreasing potential (downhill).
    \item A conductor forms an equipotential surface.
    \item When lines are more dense, the electric field is strong.

\subitem c) Gap must not contain a conductor (Typically we have a air/vacuum gap, ideally a dielectric)
\subitem d) Plates must have equal and opposite charges.
}
\dfn{The Capactior/Capacitance}{
  The units for capacitance is Farads (F).
  $$ C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V} \implies Q = C \Delta V$$
  Where $A$ is the area of the plates, $D$ is the distance between the plates, and $\kappa$ is the dielectric constant.
  $$ C = \kappa \epsilon_0 (\frac{A}{D}) $$
}
\ex{Capacitance is charge efficiency}{
  Lets say we have 2 capacitors. Capacitor A with 10 F and capactior B with 2 F.
  \\ If we charge both capacitors with 1 V. Capacitor A will store 10 C and capacitor B will store 2 C.
  \\ If we charge both capacitors with 2 V. Capacitor A will store 20 C and capacitor B will store 4 C.
  \\ Therefore, capacitance is charge efficiency, its how much charge you can hold per volt.
}
\nt{
Capacitance is a function of material and geometry not $V$ and $Q$.
Such that, we consider the area of the plates and the gap between the plates.
\double As area grows, charges on a plate can spread out more, reducing their mutual repulsion, increasing capacitance. Thus, $C \propto A$.
\double As we decrease the gap between the plates the force gets larger. Such that, a smaller gap results in a larger force, more capacity to store charges. Therefore, $C \propto \frac{1}{d}$.
}
\nt{
  \textbf{Steps to obtain capacitance}
  \nlist{
    \item Assume plates have a charge Q (of course one is pos, neg but we only care about the magnitude).
    \item Computer the $\Delta V$ between the plates, from low to high voltage to obtain $\Delta V$.
    \subitem A) Compute the electric field (via Gauss's Law), such that $\Delta V = -\int_{-}^{+} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{r}$
    \subitem B) Use the surface charge densities on the plates to compute the voltage of each
    \subitem plate and then compute the difference. $V = k \int \frac{dq}{r}$
    \item Finally, $C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$

\dfn{Dielectrics}{
  Dielectrics are materials that don't allow current to flow. They are more often called insulators because they are the exact opposite of conductors.

\ex{Simple $A \rightarrow B$ with resistor}{
  \imgg{ex25.1}{0.3 }
  The charges go from high to low voltage, such that $V_A > V_B$. Resistors cost you voltage. \\
  As all the charges must go through the $R$, the current must be the same, $I_A = I_B$.
}
\dfn{Ohm's Law}{
  Describes the relationship between a given potential difference and the current
  it generates as dictated by the resistance; subsquently that $\Delta V \propto I$.
  $$ \Delta V = IR$$
  Where $\Delta V$ is the voltage drop across the resistor, $I$ is the current flowing through the resistor, and $R$ is the resistance to the flow of charges.
}
\dfn{Electric Power $(P)$}{
  Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit.
  Rigourously, it is the rate of work done per unit time, $\frac{dW}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (q \Delta V) = I \Delta V$.

Lets take a look at another version:
\dfn{Alternating Currents (AC)}{
  Alternating currents go back and forth in a periodic manner, typically many times per second. \\
  They are generated using a waveform, typically sinusoidal.
  $$ V(t) = V_0 \sin (\omega t)$$
  Where $V_0$ is the max voltage, $f$ is the frequency of osciallation, and $\omega = 2 \pi f$ is the angular frequency.
  $$ I (t) = I_0 \sin (\omega t) $$
  Where $I_0$ is the max current.
  $$ P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{2}P_0 = I_{\text{RMS}}^2 R$$
}
\dfn{Root-Mean-Square (RMS)}{
  Because it would be nice to treat AC and DC circuits \textit{effectively} the same,
  we tend to think of the values in terms of their Root-Mean-Square (RMS) values.
  \double Such that the average a $T$ of a sin/cos graph is 0, we are going to square the given values, take the average, and then take the square root.
  $$ V_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{P_{\text{avg}}}{I_{\text{RMS}}}$$
  $$ I_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}$$

In the diagram above, the solenoid peirces the amperian loop 5 times, however, we can generalize this to $N$ times.

B=\mu_o n I
\end{gathered}

We know that the $\vec{B}$ at the point would be spherically symmetric, such that the $y$ components would cancel out. Thus, we only need to consider the $x$ components.
